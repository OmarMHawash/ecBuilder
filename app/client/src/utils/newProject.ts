      'Static Typing: One of the key advantages of using TypeScript with React is the ability to add static typing to your components and props. TypeScript allows you to define types for props, state, and other variables, making it easier to catch type-related errors during development, This feature enhances code predictability, maintainability, and helps prevent common bugs that might occur due to incorrect data types being passed between components. Enum and Union Types for Props: TypeScript enables you to use Enum and Union types to define a restricted set of values for props',
